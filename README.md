This code documents the process used to develop the EIA ArcGIS tool. 
The tool was developed in ArcGIS 10.7 and requires the Spatial Analyst extension and ArcHydro tools. ArcHydro is available for download at the following link: http://downloads.esri.com/archydro/archydro/

Preparing ArcMap for EIA Toolbox Use

1.	File structure
  
    a.	Create a new folder to house inputs and outputs
    b.	Create a new file geodatabase to hold input data (‘In.gbd’)
    c.	Create a new file geodatabase to hold output data (‘Out.gbd’)
  
2.	Set default workspace
    a.	Geoprocessing -> EnvironmentsWorkspace
    b.	Set Current Workspace to your ‘Out.gbd’ path
3.	Pathnames
    a.	File -> Map Document Properties 
    b.	Select ‘store relative pathnames to data sources’

Using the EIA toolbox

The following input data are required for using the DCIA toolbox:
1.	Digital elevation model (DEM) - 	Raster - Sufficient resolution for urban areas (< 3 m recommended)
2.	Impervious surfaces	- Polygon - Requires a field designating each polygon into one of three impervious classes: (1) Roof, (2) Roads, (3) Other.
3.	Area of interest -Polygon - Can be a watershed or city boundary, etc.
4.	Drainage points -	Point	 - Manholes, catch basins, etc.
5.	Land use- Polygon - A field designating each land use type of each polygon. Up to 3 land use types are supported. 
6.	Soil data	- can download NRCS soil data here: https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/WebSoilSurvey.aspx
    - import area of interest
    - select ‘soil data explorer’ tab
    - select’ soil properties and qualities’ tab
    - expand ‘soil physical properties’
    - select ‘saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat)’
    - select ‘view rating’, then ‘add to shopping cart’
    - click on ‘shopping cart’ and click the download link.

Limitations

The EIA ArcGIS tool was developed for a finite number of scenarios. These parameters for which the EIA ArcGIS tool is accurate are summarized in model documentation.

For additional background on the develpment of the ArcGIS tool, see model documentation here.
